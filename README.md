#  Data Mining - Dark Web Market

This repository contains all the R-code and the Report that we made during our internship at the University of East London. 

The aim of this project was to perform statistical analyses on a data set.

The data set was created by our supervisors and contains a sample more than 35 000 ads that can be found on AlphaBay (a Dark Web website).

While the data set won't be made public, feel free to clone/fork the repo and play around with it (or point out any issues you may find!)

## Architecture

In the folder Report you will find our notes and analyses. You can have a look at it with the PDF version, but if you want the full one please download "Report.nd.html" and open it in your Browser.

In the other folders you will find the complete R-code of each part we made. (You can also visualise it in the html file).
