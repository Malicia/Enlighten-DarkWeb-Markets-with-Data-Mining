#  Data Mining - Dark Web Market

This repository contains all the R code for the internship we made at UEL. 

The aim of this project was to perform statistical analyses on a data set.

The data set was created by our supervisors and contains a sample more than 35 000 ads that can be found on AlphaBay (a Dark Web website).

While the data set won't be made public, feel free to clone/fork the repo and play around with it (or point out any issues you may find!)

## Architecture

In the folder Report you will find our notes and analyses 
and the other folders the complete R code of each part we made.
